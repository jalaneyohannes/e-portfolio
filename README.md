### Reflection

**Introduction**
As a computer science major at the University of St. Thomas, I have developed a range of technical and analytical skills through various projects and coursework. This "Signature Work Portfolio" is designed to showcase my academic journey and its alignment with the common good and the mission and values of St. Thomas. The portfolio includes projects that demonstrate my ability to solve problems, engage with interdisciplinary knowledge, and contribute to the broader community.

**Connection to the Common Good and St. Thomas's Mission**
The University of St. Thomas emphasizes a commitment to the common good, ethical leadership, and the integration of faith and reason. Through my coursework and projects, I have aimed to embody these values by addressing real-world problems and creating solutions that benefit society. This reflection will explore how three of my projects—each representing different aspects of computer science—connect to these ideals.

# Project 1: To-Do List App**
- **GitHub Repository:** [To-Do List App](https://github.com/jalaneyohannes/Todo_list_app)
- **Project Description:** The To-Do List App is a simple desktop application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. Developed using Python and the Tkinter library, the app allows users to add, delete, complete, save, and load tasks. The user interface is straightforward and user-friendly, making task management accessible to everyone.
- **Connection to the Common Good:** Task management is a fundamental aspect of productivity and mental well-being. By providing a tool that helps individuals organize their tasks, this project supports personal efficiency and reduces stress. This aligns with the mission of St. Thomas to promote the common good by enhancing the quality of life and well-being of individuals.
- **Project-Specific Reflection:** The development of the To-Do List App required a practical understanding of GUI development and user experience design. Collaborating with peers to test and refine the app provided valuable feedback and demonstrated the importance of iterative development and user-centric design. This project highlighted the role of simple yet effective tools in improving daily life and personal productivity.

# Project 2: Simple weather app 

## Overview
The Weather App is a console-based application developed in Java that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates for user-specified cities. Upon entering a city name, the application fetches and displays the current temperature, humidity, and weather description.

## Project Details
- **GitHub Repository:** [Weather App](https://github.com/jalaneyohannes/simple_weatherapplication_)
- **Language Used:** Java
- **API Used:** OpenWeatherMap API

## Connection to the Common Good
The Weather App serves a vital role in advancing the common good by offering accessible weather information to individuals. In scenarios where weather conditions significantly impact daily activities or safety, such as outdoor events, travel plans, or emergency preparedness, having timely and accurate weather updates is crucial. By providing this information in a user-friendly format, the Weather App empowers users to make informed decisions, contributing to their safety and well-being.

## Project-Specific Reflection
Developing the Weather App required a deep dive into HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and API integration within the Java environment. It also prompted considerations of data reliability and efficient handling. Reflecting on this project from a domain-specific angle, the importance of understanding meteorological concepts became evident. Integrating weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API necessitated comprehension of weather variables, such as temperature and humidity, and their significance in forecasting and understanding local weather conditions. Additionally, considerations of how different weather phenomena impact daily activities underscored the practical implications of this project. This intersection of software development with meteorological knowledge highlights the interdisciplinary nature of technology projects and their potential to address domain-specific challenges.


# Project 3: Chat Application
- **GitHub Repository:** [Chat Application](https://github.com/jalaneyohannes/Todo_list_app)
- **Project Description:** The Chat Application is a web-based application that allows users to communicate in real-time through a chat interface. Developed using Python with Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, the application utilizes WebSocket for real-time messaging. Users can send and receive messages instantly, providing a seamless communication experience.
- **Connection to the Common Good:** Effective communication is essential for community building and collaboration. This Chat Application provides a simple yet powerful platform for individuals to connect and communicate instantly. By facilitating real-time interaction, the app supports social connectedness and collaboration, aligning with the mission of St. Thomas to advance the common good by fostering community engagement and connectivity.
- **Project-Specific Reflection:** The development of the Chat Application required a comprehensive understanding of WebSocket communication, server-client interaction, and frontend-backend integration. This project enhanced my skills in these areas, particularly in using Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication. It also emphasized the importance of responsive design and user experience in web development. Working on this project demonstrated the potential of web technologies to create interactive and engaging applications that meet the needs of users.

**Conclusion**
The projects included in this portfolio illustrate my journey as a computer science major and my commitment to using technology for the common good. Each project, through its unique focus and interdisciplinary nature, aligns with the mission and values of the University of St. Thomas. By addressing healthcare, environmental sustainability, and education, these projects demonstrate how computer science can contribute to solving real-world problems and promoting the common good.
